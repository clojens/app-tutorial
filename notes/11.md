> **Checked?** yes (1 time) 
> **Tests?** yes (4 pass 0 fail)
> **Documents:** README does not reflect correct procedure, or if it does, then demonstration as implied by title of the sample does not come forward when running the sample, since it does not get called nor does any routing change or README mention any such thing relevant to the case
> **QA/Advisory notes:** possibly add tests to alter the routing to assert for correct behavior of auto-reloading when running unit tests; also to add some way of demonstrating this to the user or explain how they can see auto-reloading work for them
> **Attest?** When issues are solved/decided on a proper course of action.
