Hmm... guess some of my notes on introduction of the topics/subjects can be negated by perhaps referencing the [todo app beginners document](https://github.com/taylorSando/pedestal-todo/blob/master/beginners.md) for complete beginners, as I found it provides a more gentle introduction/overview of pedestal. Dunno, just a thought.
