Also, separate from the content comments, personally I'd say the piece way below in the `Testing` chapter, on sharing code, should probably be somewhere on top of the next chapter. Since I was not interested in much testing, originally I skipped the chapter. Then a few hours later, when trying the `java.util.Date` in `behavior.clj` I obviously noticed this wouldn't work. I had completely missed the `^:shared` reader tag :) But maybe that's just me though, I've used clojure for a fair bit, clojurescript far less.
