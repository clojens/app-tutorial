I got a nice way, once I figured out how to rid myself of this nasty log4j stuff, following the tutorial. My remarks are on the tutorial, I guess my main concern is that I find it sometimes hard to distinguish between code blocks, probably the reason `screenshot 1` I got this `p` exception but I don't really know where I missed something.

I think my problem might have been caused by navigating between IDE and tutorial, and it is made harder by the fact that you mix example snippets with snippets that you need to copy paste inside to keep following-along. This needs to be made more clear to a reader, perhaps by a consistent header for the copy-paste parts and just keep the other ones inline with the paragraph and explicitly note that a section is often closed with the final piece that you can use. It's a shame that markdown doesn't allow much, GFM you might be able to use icons or something, I don't know (just shooting some stuff here) but my main point remains: *I have to read the text, to figure out if this piece is meant to be copied, if so where exactly and is it the entire piece, or just a key or just a value that you use?* All the while deciphering new jargon doesn't make it easier. Perhaps some food for thought or if you'd like me to point out those pieces, really goes for most tags I guess the pattern reoccurs: text with code snippets, then a final snippet the reader can use for himself. Clarify this in a visual, obvious manner I'd say. 

One example where this is not entirely obvious while **glancing** over texts is:

It's a bit silly perhaps, I'm playing extra dumb, but hey, that's how my brain works :S I mean this as a serious consideration though, especially for tutorials. Imho *but this is opinion*, I find the following style better suited like [here](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Web_Platform/5/html/Hibernate_Core_Reference_Guide/tutorial.html) but I realize we are limited by github here in how we can layout stuff. So perhaps a explicit **copy the following to xyz** may negate some of the limiting options of layout of the outline in markdown.

This though, is already by these minor adjustments, a lot more readable:

Second issue, is a slight 'error' the tutorial at 2.0.4 doesn't mention you need to add the services require in the ns macro, but it's not there either so it failed to run `main` at first until I added the `services` alias in `start.cljs`:

Again navigating the document, this time files and the *where-am-I?* issue. Imagine the new user has to navigate probably 2, perhaps even 3 windows. Not everyone uses LT the way I do so I imagine it being worse even. The screenshot highlights an occurrence of this styling where I find it hard to quickly check if I did something right in my IDE window, file navigator, then check the tutorial again, I have to look and read pieces before I figure out which file it was again. This might be better highlighted, perhaps even by a `####`.

Somewhere it isn't obvious **where** to do something, be more explicit I'd say:

And this really goes for the referencing namespaces, although technically correct, most people probably operate in this fashion:

Air Force academy probably drilled those `who, what, where, when, why` too much (the *why* because we're Dutch, of course) but it could also be my right-sided brain that just responds hard to anything without colors.

Hope you may find this useful, or disregard :)

Cheers,
Rob
