Tag **2.0.2**

One occasion where imho the order is reversed, is when the term `deltas` is used. It did not really receive proper introduction, so you might want to consider move around some stuff and perhaps elaborate a tad more on what the difference/relation between a `message` and a `delta` is. At the moment (playing dumb again) they all look the same to me. Also, here I have to check and check again *Do I copy anything? What should I do?* and while figuring that out, find that later (after 3 occurrences), the term `delta` is indeed explained albeit not in a very comprehensive way but ok. Now of course, as a somewhat educated programmer I can relate to the term deltas, but that is not the point. The point goes even for backtracking, I might realize the second or third time the term was used, that it conflicts with some assumptions I made perhaps, or my own frame of references and might only after a few times seeing it think *Hey, this is not what I thought it was.* Then checking again the definition, I should probably be able to find it in the start.

Still tag 2.0.2, Incrementing the counter:

Apparently there is quite some black magic going on, or I release missed something obvious, but consider the following from 2.0.2 still:

This is where I got really lost now, because the rewrite of the transform enable, where is the `:increment-counter` coming from? Why can I abbreviate it as `:inc` and it still works? You must really explain what is going on, instead of just stating this is a *shorter way to write it*. Now I see the pattern, but this part remains a bit in the dark and doesn't help to clarify what is already a difficult subject, I assume for most anyway since no one instantly *knows* an API :) My point is again, to be careful throwing around examples and new terms without some proper introduction, building the bridges between different subjects should be captured in those by means of referral to previously learned things. It's little words that can make a great difference here. For e.g. with the sentence

> Here the op is `:transform-enable`

You might want to write something like

> The aforementioned op, in this case, is the `:transform-enable` key. Recall those had a structure of `[:op [:path] args]`? Notice the same pattern here, only now the path is `[:main :my-counter]`. 

Perhaps a bit nitpicking, I'll admit. But you need to adjust the style of writing in a few cases to accommodate for the public of tutorials.

In overall, part of these minor writing-style issues can also be resolved by providing a bullet list / closure of the topic by giving the highlights of the topic (gist of it, conclusions, summary). Providing a introduction in a similar way, *what you will learn this chapter* style of briefly touching the subjects and how they will affect me as a reader e.g.

```
You will learn:
* that x is a special case of y
* how those two interact in the context of a, b and c
* the best practices to handle with z which is produced as a result of a and b
```

I think someone else also mentioned in a topic the use of hyperlinks. Pointing to source code is a big pain (since it changes and those are line-numbers so changes above the referenced line will cause an offset in the permanent http value of the anchor caused by the dynamic code). But what you can do, is perhaps, also as extra friendliness, now and then when you reference to old topics (of which you think it still doesn't come across) and link back to those chapters. The uri's generated from the markdown, unless you really throw the entire structure overboard (heading titles) are more or less certain to remain in-tact and correct and it saves a lot of back and forth skipping, reading definitions, looking up what you learned last day or where you left after you've zoned out :D

Sorry for the many comments, by no means do I want to flame or anything, but I think a few minor adjustments here and there (basically try and place yourself in the reader who knows nothing) would really boost the readability of the document itself. I did this for a living in military (digital) education, writing school plans and such, maybe that's why I like these things fool-proof, explicit and early-binding the term to a definition, over implicit and late-binding the term to a definition/context so to speak. This avoids many needless prolonged 'aha' moments.
